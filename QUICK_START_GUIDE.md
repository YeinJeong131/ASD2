### Badge Integration with Comments
Every comment/reply automatically increments the user's badge contribution count:
```java
// Automatically happens when posting comments
badgeService.incrementContribution(userId);
```

### Database Tables Created
The app will automatically create these tables on startup:
- `comments` - stores all comments and replies
- `badges` - stores user badges and contribution counts

## 📝 API Endpoints Available
