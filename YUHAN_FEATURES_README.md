## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### 2. Access the Database
Make sure MySQL is running with the `betterpedia` database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS betterpedia;
```

The application will automatically create the tables on startup (due to `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`).

### 3. Test the Features

**As a User:**
1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to `/discussion/1` (or any article ID)
3. Post a comment
4. Reply to someone's comment
5. Check your badge at `/badges`
6. See your contribution count increase

**As an Admin:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to a discussion page
3. Delete inappropriate comments
4. Go to `/badges`
5. Use admin controls to manage user badges

### 4. Integration with Badge System

Every time a user posts a comment or reply, their badge contribution count is automatically incremented:

```java
// In CommentController.createComment()
Comment comment = commentService.createComment(userId, articleId, content);
badgeService.incrementContribution(userId); // Automatically updates badge
```

Badge levels are updated automatically:
- 0-19 contributions: Bronze 🥉
- 20-49 contributions: Silver 🥈
- 50-99 contributions: Gold 🥇
- 100+ contributions: Platinum 💎

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### 1. **Unidirectional Relationships**
Both Comment and Badge entities have unidirectional relationships with User. This keeps the User entity clean and avoids modifying other team members' code.

### 2. **Soft Delete for Comments**
Comments are soft-deleted (marked as `deleted=true`) rather than hard-deleted to preserve discussion thread integrity.

### 3. **Automatic Badge Updates**
Badge levels are automatically calculated based on contribution count using the `updateBadgeLevel()` method, ensuring consistency.

### 4. **Session-Based Authentication**
Following the existing project pattern, authentication uses HttpSession rather than JWT or Spring Security.

### 5. **RESTful API Design**
Separate REST controllers for API endpoints and page controllers for rendering HTML, following Spring MVC best practices.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Application Properties
The features use the existing configuration in `application.properties`:
- Database: MySQL on `localhost:3306/betterpedia`
- JPA: Auto-create/update tables
- Server: Port 8080

### No Additional Configuration Needed
All features work with the existing configuration. Just start the app and the tables will be created automatically.

## 📊 Testing Results

```bash
./gradlew test

> Task :test

CommentServiceTest > Create comment - Success PASSED
CommentServiceTest > Reply to comment - Success PASSED
CommentServiceTest > Delete comment by admin - Success PASSED
BadgeServiceTest > Increment contribution - Level upgrade to Silver PASSED
BadgeServiceTest > Get badge statistics - Success PASSED
...

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
